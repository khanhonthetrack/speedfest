## Session 1 — 2026-10-14

### User (verbatim)

> My ultimate goal is to build a Trackmania clone (of course slightly different due to copyright) on Nintendo Switch (or better, Switch 2).
>
> To this end, first build a web-based version of the game. The first suggestion would be: there are 3 generic tracks (you build it), a player has a choice to pick which car to pick (build 3 cars). Implement the online version so that tomorrow me and 2-4 friends can play together.
>
> I want a vibe of Need For Speed Underground 2. The cars (3 cars) can be tuned, in terms of efficiency, but also in style - hood, bonnet, colours below the cars.
>
> Ask me any design questions you may have. I want good graphics for nintendo switch, for web it's not necessary maybe. Use Godot Engine, focus on beautiful graphics.
>
> IMPORTANT: Every step, every progress, every plan, even this transcript, save in the speedfest github, so that other claude agent can pick it up and continue.

### Claude

- Checked the environment: the repo was empty. Installed Godot **4.7.2-stable** and its export
  templates (web, linux, windows), and Mesa lavapipe/llvmpipe so Godot can render
  real screenshots headlessly under Xvfb (both Forward+ and Compatibility work).
- Confirmed with the Godot docs that **web exports only support the Compatibility
  renderer (WebGL 2)**. Forward+ and Mobile need native APIs, and Godot has no WebGPU support yet.
  So the plan is Forward+ on desktop/console and Compatibility on web, with graceful
  quality tiers.
- Asked 4 design questions:

| Question | Options offered | **Answer** |
|---|---|---|
| How should online races work? | Both modes w/ ghosts · Time Attack only · Lap race ghosts · Lap race w/ collisions | **Time Attack only** |
| Track setting? | One of each (neon city / neon stunt stadium / dusk coast) · All night-city · All stunt | **One of each** |
| 3 car types? | JDM coupe + muscle + supercar · All tuner cars · Tuner + rally + buggy | **JDM coupe, muscle, supercar** |
| Devices for tomorrow? (multi) | Browser+keyboard · Gamepads · Windows build · Mac/Linux build | **Browser + keyboard** |

- Wrote the design (`docs/DESIGN.md`), architecture and interface contracts
  (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`), roadmap (`docs/PLAN.md`), progress log
  (`docs/PROGRESS.md`), and the Switch port notes (`docs/SWITCH.md`).
- Set up the Godot project skeleton and test tooling, then started parallel
  implementation of the modules (see `docs/PROGRESS.md` for what happened next).
