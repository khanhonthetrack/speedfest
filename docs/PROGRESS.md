# Progress log

Chronological, newest at the bottom. Every agent appends an entry after meaningful work:
date, who (module/agent), what changed, what's next or blocked.

## 2026-10-14 — Session 1 (orchestrator)

- **M0 bootstrap done.**
  - Installed Godot 4.7.2 + templates. Verified headless screenshots under Xvfb on both renderers
    (llvmpipe/lavapipe).
  - Owner answered the design questions: Time Attack only, one track per theme (city / stunt arena /
    coast), JDM coupe + muscle + supercar, browser + keyboard.
  - Wrote DESIGN, ARCHITECTURE (interface contracts), PLAN (module ownership), SWITCH, and CLAUDE.md.
  - Godot skeleton: Settings (quality tiers, env tuning, input map, audio buses), Profile (garage,
    PBs, ghosts), Game (scene flow), TestHooks (CLI test/screenshot hooks), CarDefs (3 cars,
    shared geometry, style schema, sanitizer), TrackDefs, TrackPath (road frames with working loops
    and banking, tested), and stubs for Net/Audio/Car/CarVisual/Tuning/Track/Race/main menu.
  - Tools: `tools/godot_import.sh`, `check_scripts.sh`, `run_scene.sh`, `export_web.sh`.
- **Next:** M1, 8 module agents in parallel (networking, car physics, car visuals, track builder,
  scenery, UI, audio, race), each on its own branch, then integration.

## 2026-10-14 ~23:10 — M1 launched (orchestrator)

- Started 8 module agents in parallel. Each builds in its own git worktree and pushes to
  `module/<key>`. An independent reviewer then audits and fixes the work on the same branch:
  `networking`, `audio`, `physics`, `race`, `visuals`, `scenery`, `tracks`, `ui`.
- The full per-module specs given to the agents are in the workflow script. The essentials are in
  docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/PLAN.md. Each module documents itself in `docs/modules/<key>.md`.
- Next: merge all `module/*` branches into `main` (M2 integration).

## 2026-10-15 ~00:05 UTC — Takeover (orchestrator #2, session_01FScTiQ4vwQQ8wktXzQJ6Ey)

- The first orchestrator (session_01CMDh9pTv1h5xawNJJ9eFH2) stopped after pushing only
  `module/networking` (last push 23:25). The owner said it got stuck and asked this session to continue.
- Merged `module/networking`: Node server (rooms, round flow, static + gzip/br), real WebSocket
  `Net` client. Verified: `npm test` 10/10, `tools/net_smoke_test.sh` PASS (3 headless clients, 81 checks).
  Net also adds `player_checkpoint`, `finish_result` signals, `server_now_ms()`, `round_time_left_ms()`.
- Environment note: `downloads.godotengine.org` is blocked here; Godot + templates come from the
  GitHub release mirror (CLAUDE.md updated).
- Added core `game/ui/ui_theme.gd` (`UITheme`: palette, fonts, shared Theme, time formatting) so
  the UI work can be split into `ui_menus` and `ui_hud` without both touching a theme.
- Relaunched the remaining M1 modules as parallel cloud sessions (this container has 4 CPUs):
  physics, visuals, tracks, scenery, ui_menus, ui_hud, audio, race. Each starts from branch
  `ccr-49301774-b5a4ns`, works only in its owned files, documents itself in `docs/modules/<key>.md`
  and pushes to its own session branch. The orchestrator merges them into `ccr-49301774-b5a4ns`.
- Module sessions (spawned 00:11 UTC, each pushes to its own `ccr-*` branch; specs in `docs/M1_SPECS.md`):
  physics `session_01DrvZUyYAM3oczRVDW1o8Nf`, visuals `session_012FyHiPM6GP1ACSFBLqmWJV`,
  tracks `session_01XWgKiHbRtgKdaQBXSuzZm7`, scenery `session_019ZpoTQnjd2NsrKfAdGeECh`,
  ui_menus `session_018sRqzobba64dP5Ld7SByiE`, ui_hud `session_015JD5jMrvZQVTcVqfNyySq9`,
  audio `session_018yYJrBdZh6uuXVdUQqViJH`, race `session_01UXTHDb9Svwh7v9CKVysey7`.
- Next (orchestrator): web export pipeline check with stubs, HOSTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md Net
  additions; then merge module branches as they land (M2).
